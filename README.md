# Jahia `llms.txt` Manager

The **`llms.txt` Manager Module** provides a simple interface in Jahia to configure and publish [`llms.txt`](https://llmstxt.org/) files directly from your site settings.  
No manual file editing is required â€” everything is handled from the Jahia UI.

---

## ðŸ“– What is `llms.txt`?

`llms.txt` is an emerging standard designed to give Large Language Models (LLMs) a **structured and curated entry point** into your website.  
It highlights the most relevant resources (in Markdown), making your content easier for LLMs to use at **inference time**.

Think of it as **robots.txt for LLMs** â€” but instead of crawl instructions, it provides high-quality content references.
